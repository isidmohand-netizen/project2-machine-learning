# Customer Churn Prediction with PySpark

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **PySpark** for building a **machine learning model** to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company. By analyzing historical customer data, this project identifies key factors contributing to churn and provides actionable insights to reduce it and improve customer retention.

The guided project covers:
- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation (Decision Trees, Random Forest, or other ML algorithms)
- Prediction and actionable insights

**Duration:** ~90 minutes  
**Platform:** Coursera – *Machine Learning with PySpark: Customer Churn Analysis*  
**Technologies:** PySpark, Python, MLlib
